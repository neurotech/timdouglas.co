                                    I played a core role in the conceptualisation, planning, and development of the
                                    standalone versions of Financial Statements and Industry Analytics, both
                                    requiring a separation process from the Phocas Analytics monolith.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            <strong>Stack:</strong> TypeScript (React, Redux, MobX, zod); C# (Web API);
                                            SQL (PostgreSQL); AWS Lambda; GraphQL; Docker; Octopus; GitHub Actions;
                                            Jenkins

                                <li>
                                    Collaborated with another developer to build an internal repository of UI
                                    components to share across product codebases to ensure UI & UX consistency and
                                    improved maintainability. This project grew from a two person spike into a
                                    mature shared project with stakeholders involved from multiple aspects of the
                                    business.

                                <li>
                                    Over the period of Jan. 2023 to Mar. 2023, I volunteered to undergo a secondment
                                    to the Professional Services team in Phocas. This experience was invaluable in
                                    contributing to my growth as an engineer, namely due to the following:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            I worked on Jira tickets that involved implementing solutions to customer
                                            problems within the Phocas product.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Collaborating directly with customers via Zoom to ensure these solutions
                                            matched their needs and achieved their desired outcomes.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Working within a costing & budget focused model gave me a fresh perspective
                                            on how different teams operate and how that affects motivation.

                                    I made high-quality, sustained contributions to the Phocas Analytics monolith
                                    codebase driven by customer needs, feedback, and market trends.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>

                                    I was a key contributor to the creation and continued improvement of the
                                    Phocas Financial Statements product.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The Financial Statements product was a success and played a crucial part
                                            of Phocas being able to get access to additional sources of new customers
                                            previously inaccessible to the business.
